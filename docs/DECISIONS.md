# Architecture decision records

Format: context → decision → consequences. Append new ADRs; never rewrite accepted ones
(supersede them instead).

## ADR-001 Desktop shell: Tauri 2 — Accepted
Reuse Rufplan's React skills and components, native Rust backend, small installers.
Electron rejected (JS-only compute, large binaries). Qt kept as fallback if webview/native
integration becomes a blocker (see ADR-004).

## ADR-002 Core engine in Rust — Accepted
Memory safety, performance, good tooling, and clean integration with Tauri. C++ libraries
(OpenCascade, IfcOpenShell) are reached through FFI when needed.

## ADR-003 Project file is SQLite — Accepted
Transactional saves, incremental writes, queryable, and a natural base for a change log
and sync. Elements stored as MessagePack blobs with indexed header columns.

## ADR-004 Rendering: display lists computed in Rust, drawn in the webview — Accepted
Canvas 2D first, WebGL2 when needed; three.js for 3D. Keeps all geometry in Rust while
reusing the web UI. Revisit a native `wgpu` viewport if models of ~10k+ elements are
too slow after WebGL2 optimization.

## ADR-005 Internal units: millimeters (f64), UUID v7 IDs — Accepted
SI internally avoids imperial rounding bugs; display defaults to US architectural ft-in.

## ADR-006 Geometry kernel: native prismatic first, OpenCascade later — Accepted
v0.1 elements are all vertical extrusions, which a small native kernel handles exactly and
fast. A `GeometryKernel` trait isolates this so OCCT (via `opencascade-rs` or a `cxx`
bridge, LGPL, dynamically linked) can be introduced for roofs, sloped/curved geometry,
and exact hidden-line removal without rewriting callers.

## ADR-007 IFC4 as the interchange format; IFC export hand-written — Accepted
Keeps the build free of heavy C++ dependencies in v0.1. IfcOpenShell is used only in
tests to validate output. IFC import is deferred.

## ADR-008 DWG deferred — Accepted
ODA SDK requires paid membership; LibreDWG is GPL, incompatible with closed distribution.
Revisit after v0.1 based on user demand.

## ADR-009 M0 scaffold choices — Accepted (2026-09-23)
Context: the handoff left several M0-level choices open.
Decision:
- **IPC type generation: `ts-rs`.** Stable, and needs no changes to Tauri command
  registration. `tauri-specta` for Tauri 2 was still a release candidate. Payload structs
  derive `TS`; `cargo test` writes `app/src/bindings/`, and CI fails if they drift.
- **Save strategy.** The in-memory project is written to `<file>.rfproj.tmp` in a single
  SQLite transaction, then renamed over the target. The project file is never held open
  between saves. Autosave (from M1) will write `<file>.rfproj.autosave` the same way.
  Migrations apply on write, so opening an older file and saving it upgrades it.
- **Schema 1 = `meta` table only.** Element tables arrive in M1 as migration 0002.
- **Frontend pins.** React 18 as locked (new Tauri templates default to 19). TypeScript
  6.0.x, because typescript-eslint does not yet support TypeScript 7.
- **Menu.** A native Tauri menu forwards item ids to the UI as a `menu` event. The UI owns
  the file dialogs and calls the project commands. This keeps dialogs as UI and project
  state in Rust.
- **Bundle target.** NSIS installer only for now; MSI is not needed yet.
Consequences: IPC payload types must derive `TS` and be exported. Saves rewrite the whole
file, which is fine for v0.1 model sizes. Incremental writes (ADR-003) can come later
without a format change.
